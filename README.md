Collection of problems available at https://projecteuler.net/

---

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

**Languages Used:**
* C, C++, JavaScript, PHP, Python3

**Note: I will be changing these problems to include user input (where applicable)**
